## 🚀 Getting Started

### Try It Online

Visit **[noteel.com](https://noteel.com)** and start taking notes immediately! The app runs entirely in your browser.

### Choose Your Storage

On first launch, select your preferred storage option:
- **🏠 Local Storage**: Notes saved in browser (no cloud sync)
- **📦 Dropbox**: Sync with your Dropbox account
- **📘 OneDrive**: Sync with Microsoft OneDrive  
- **📗 Google Drive**: Sync with Google Drive
- **⏸️ Decide Later**: Start with local storage, choose later

## 📖 How It Works

### Note Organization

- **Folders**: Organize notes into hierarchical folders
- **Markdown Files**: Each note is a plain `.md` file
- **View Modes**: Switch between list view and masonry grid view per folder
- **Soft Delete**: Prefix files with `~` to soft-delete (easily restore later)
- **Search**: Powerful search across all notes and content

### Rich Editing

The editor supports:
- **Headers**: H1-H6 headings
- **Formatting**: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight
- **Lists**: Bullet lists, numbered lists, and task lists with checkboxes
- **Code**: Inline code and code blocks
- **Quotes**: Block quotes for emphasis
- **Live Preview**: See formatted output as you type

### Folder Configuration

Each folder can contain a `.noteel` file with folder-specific settings:
```json
{
  "view": "masonry",  // or "list"
  "order": ["note1.md", "note2.md"]  // custom note ordering
}
```

## 🔄 Sync Strategy

Noteel uses an intelligent offline-first sync approach:

1. **Offline First**: All changes saved locally immediately
2. **Auto Sync**: When online, syncs to cloud automatically (10s after last edit)
3. **Periodic Check**: Checks for remote changes every 60 seconds
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging when conflicts detected
5. **Manual Sync**: Force sync anytime via sync buttons

## ⚙️ Extensions & Themes

### Extensions

Extend Noteel's functionality by adding extensions to `.noteel/extensions/`:
- Each extension has a `manifest.json` file
- Auto-update checking for newer versions
- Enable/disable extensions from settings
- Access to Noteel API for deep integration

### Themes

Customize the look with CSS themes in `.noteel/themes/`:
- Add custom themes via file upload or URL
- Select active theme from settings
- Default theme included

## 🔐 Cloud Storage

## 🔐 Cloud Storage

### OAuth Authentication

Each cloud provider uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. The authentication flow happens entirely client-side:
1. User clicks on a cloud provider
2. A popup opens to the provider's OAuth page
3. User grants permission
4. Access token is securely stored in localStorage
5. App automatically syncs notes from the cloud

**Note**: To use cloud storage, you need to set up OAuth applications for each provider. See [OAUTH_SETUP.md](OAUTH_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Storage Adapters

All storage providers implement a common interface:
- `listFiles()` - Get all note files
- `listFolders()` - Get folder structure
- `getFileContent(path)` - Read a note
- `saveFileContent(path, content)` - Write a note
- `deleteFile(path)` - Remove a note

This modular design makes it easy to add new providers (Git, iCloud, WebDAV coming soon!).

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for package management)
- A local web server (service workers require HTTP/HTTPS)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/noteel.git
cd noteel

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Locally

You need a local web server (service workers require HTTP/HTTPS, not `file://` protocol):

```bash
# Option 1: Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server -p 8000

# Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📦 Building for Production

Noteel is a zero-build PWA - no compilation needed!

### Deployment Steps

1. **Upload files** to your web server
2. **Enable HTTPS** (required for service workers)
3. **Update OAuth** redirect URIs in provider dashboards
4. **Configure** client IDs in `core/auth.js` for production domain
5. **Test** the service worker and offline functionality
